Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements.

A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in.
