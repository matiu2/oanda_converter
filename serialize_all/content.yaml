      doc_string: |-
        Get a stream of Account Prices starting from when the request is made.
        This pricing stream does not include every single price created for the Account, but instead will provide at most 4 prices per second (every 250 milliseconds) for each instrument being requested.
        If more than one price is created for an instrument during the 250 millisecond window, only the price in effect at the end of the window is sent. This means that during periods of rapid price movement, subscribers to this stream will not be sent every price.
        Pricing windows for different connections to the price stream are not all aligned in the same way (i.e. they are not all aligned to the top of the second). This means that during periods of rapid price movement, different subscribers may observe different prices depending on their alignment.

This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.

          doc_string: Specification of which price component should be used when determining if an Order should be triggered and filled. This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.

Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in.

This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.

This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.

This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.

Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.

This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.

This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.
